    description: "I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science with a Cyber Security specialization course. I am proficient in Python and have worked with many libraries. I am sure I can solve problems of difficulty level 8/10. I am a CTF player with 2 years of experience. I have little experience with forensics and malware analysis. I have a special interest in digital forensics and malware analysis. I have always been focused on sharpening my skills in these specific domains, and I like prompting with AI and have created many websites and projects with that.",
